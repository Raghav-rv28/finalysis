According to the state government, almost 90 per cent of passengers don’t reach the cap. Instead, Friday fares will be made cheaper, with passengers to receive a 30 per cent discount on Metro, train, bus and light rail services. Adult commuters will be able to travel all day for a maximum cost of $8.90 while children, youth and concession fares will be capped at $4.45. The NSW government said it has ”worked to relieve cost-of-commuting pressures” by delaying the increases — which usually kick in at the start of each financial year — and by ensuring they were less than the more recent Sydney Consumer price index movement. “Every weekend will soon be a long weekend when it comes to Opal fares, as we make Friday travel cheaper for everyone — trimming the cost of visiting the city be it for work, to shop or to enjoy a day and night out on the town,” NSW Transport Minister Jo Haylen said.",

      "content": "Paris Saint-Germain's Lee Kang-in reacts during the French League One football match between Paris Saint-Germain and FC Lorient in Paris, France, Aug. 12. EPA-Yonhap Hwang Sun-hong, head coach of the Korean men's Asian Games football team, said Thursday he is \"frustrated\" with the lingering uncertainty over the status of Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) midfielder Lee Kang-in. Hwang named Lee to his under-24 squad for the Hangzhou Asian Games in July. With Korea's first group stage match only five days away in China, however, Lee has yet to join Hwang's team, nor is it clear exactly when the 22-year-old midfielder will do so. \"I am frustrated. I've been in touch with Kang-in personally, and he'd love to join us as soon as he can. But our talks with PSG over the timing of his release haven't gone well,\" Hwang told reporters before a training session at the National Football Center in Paju, Gyeonggi Province. \"The Korea Football Association has been in close contact with PSG. I hope the situation gets resolved quickly so that we can all focus on the team here. I'd love to have him for at least a couple of matches for the group stage.\" Hwang Sun-hong, manager of the Korean men's Asian Games football team, speaks to reporters before a training session at the National Football Center in Paju, Gyeonggi Province, Sept. 14. Yonhap Lee, one of Korea's most skilled and creative players, will be an integral piece for the young Taegeuk Warriors as they try to win the country's third consecutive Asiad men's football title. The opening ceremony of the Asian Games is Sept. 23, but the group stage for the men's football tournament will kick off early next week. Korea's first Group E match will be against Kuwait next Tuesday, and the next match is against Thailand next Thursday. They will wrap up the group stage against Bahrain on Sept. 24. The Asian Games aren't part of the FIFA international calendar, and clubs aren't required to release their players. \"Ideally, it'd be great to have him play a couple of matches in the group stage before getting into the knockout stage,\" Hwang said. \"If not, then we will have to prepare for different contingencies. The earlier this decision is made, the better it is for us to make plans. It's a frustrating situation.\" Hwang said PSG are trying to work out a deal whereby they will send Lee early for the Asian Games but hold on to him a little longer before the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Asian Cup tournament in January in Qatar. Paris Saint-Germain's Lee Kang-in, left, controls the ball in front of Lorient's Vincent Le Goff during the French League One football match between Paris Saint-Germain and Lorient at the Parc des Princes stadium in Paris, France, Aug. 12. AP-Yonhap \"I think they want things to work in their favor, and we need to negotiate a few things,\" Hwang added. Lee's recent stint on the sidelines due to a left quadriceps injury has made his Asiad status even more difficult to predict. Lee has been out of action since late August but returned to training earlier this week. He missed two friendly matches for the senior national team earlier this month, and Hwang had been hoping Lee would recover in time for the Asian Games. \"PSG were supposed to tell us by Wednesday whether Kang-in had fully recovered and when he could join us, but they haven't given us any answer on that front,\" Hwang said. \"He has told me that he doesn't expect to play (for PSG) on Saturday. I think he's mostly healthy now, and it seems to be a matter of getting back into match shape.\" Hwang said he has not yet thought about the possibility of not having Lee at all for the Asian Games. Hwang Sun-hong, manager of the Korean men's Asian Games football team, speaks to reporters before a training session at the National Football Center in Paju, Gyeonggi Province, Sept. 14. Yonhap \"If we only get to have him for the final, then it'd be a different story. But we are not at that point yet,\" Hwang added. With or without Lee, Hwang said the goal for the team doesn't change. \"We know what our fans expect from us, and we have a clearly defined goal,\" Hwang said. \"If we work hard and do our best, we can absolutely accomplish our goal.\" The Asian Games men's football competition is typically open to players under 23, with each team allowed to select up to three overage players. For this year's competition, which was postponed by 12 months because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the age limit was raised to 24. There will be six groups of four in action. The top two teams from each group, along with the four best third-place teams, will advance to the knockout stage. (Yonhap)",

      "description": "Jurgen Klinsmann, much-maligned head coach of the South Korean men's national football team, on Thursday called on the public and media to help build \"a positive spirit\" around his players as they gear up for a big continental tournament next year.",
      "content": "Jurgen Klinsmann, head coach of the South Korean men's football team, speaks to reporters at Incheon International Airport, west of Seoul, Thursday. Yonhap Jurgen Klinsmann, much-maligned head coach of the South Korean men's national football team, on Thursday called on the public and media to help build \"a positive spirit\" around his players as they gear up for a big continental tournament next year. Klinsmann returned to South Korea on Thursday following a last-minute schedule change from the previous day in Europe. After South Korea completed their two-match trip to Wales and England on Tuesday, Klinsmann had initially planned to see South Korean internationals in action in Europe. His itinerary included a trip to Germany to watch Bayern Munich defender Kim Min-jae in the Bundesliga at the weekend. However, the Korea Football Association (KFA) announced Wednesday evening that Klinsmann would instead fly back to South Korea on Thursday and scout players in the domestic K League before announcing the next edition of the national team for October friendlies. South Korea will host Tunisia on Oct. 13 and Vietnam on Oct. 17. On the latest trip, South Korea had a goalless draw against Wales but defeated Saudi Arabia 1-0 for Klinsmann's first win in charge of the Taegeuk Warriors. Klinsmann said the latest camp was an opportunity for him and his staff to learn more about the team in the buildup to the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Asian Cup kicking off in January in Qatar. \"It was a good learning camp with a lot of positives,\" Klinsmann told reporters at Incheon International Airport, west of Seoul. \"Step by step, we're growing together.\" The KFA on Wednesday didn't provide reasons for Klinsmann's schedule change, though Klinsmann might have been mindful of mounting criticism over his work habits. Klinsmann calls criticism against football-playing son 'absolutely stupid' 2023-09-14 21:28 | Sports Klinsmann had been under fire for having spent more time overseas than in South Korea, despite vowing at the start of his tenure in March that he would live here to learn about the new country and its culture. While staying in his Los Angeles home, Klinsmann also moonlighted as a European football analyst for ESPN and attended the draw ceremony for the UEFA Champions League in Monaco, leaving the grunt work of K League scouting to his assistants. That South Korea did not win their first five matches under Klinsmann didn't help the narrative surrounding the coach. When asked why he made the change, Klinsmann smiled and quipped, \"Because you asked for it.\" \"The KFA said there's a lot of media waiting normally for the team when they come back home. And so I said, 'No problem. I can switch plans,'\" Klinsmann added, turning more serious. \"And I will go to the two games this weekend (in the K League), no problem.\" Klinsmann reiterated his goal of winning the Asian Cup, something South Korea last did in 1960. The coach said his team will need help from the public and the media if they were to end the long title drought. \"It's vital that everybody builds a positive spirit. The fans, the media and the team, obviously,\" he said. \"If it doesn't go well, there is enough time to criticize or fire the coach or do whatever you want to. But in the buildup to a tournament, a national team especially needs the help of the fans and the media to believe in it and to build a positive momentum.\" Klinsmann cited Germany's disappointing showing at the 2022 FIFA World Cup as an example, claiming that negativity surrounding the team led to Germany's stunning exit in the group stage. On multiple occasions during the scrum, Klinsmann referred to the Asian Cup as \"the benchmark\" by which his staff and his players should be measured. He said he will take whatever shots that come his way if South Korea fall short of the Asian title. And despite persistent criticism over his commitment to South Korea and lack of tactical acumen, Klinsmann said he will lean on his considerable tournament experience to get the job done at the Asian Cup. The former German international starred at three World Cups and coached his native country to third place at the 2006 World Cup. As head coach of the United States, Klinsmann lifted the 2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup trophy. \"Absolutely, if you're not doing well, then you should be questioned,\" he said. \"But I have a lot of experience, especially with tournaments. And I love tournaments. I know how to time things towards a tournament, and that's why I think the biggest point is that this team keeps growing and stays healthy. The benchmark for us is the Asian Cup. We believe that we can win the Asian Cup.\" Klinsmann said he isn't about to change the way he operates, as he plans to keep splitting his time between South Korea and overseas to help prepare the team for the Asian Cup. Between the October friendlies and the January-February tournament, South Korea will play early qualifying matches for the 2026 FIFA World Cup in November. (Yonhap)",

      "content": "A scene from the musical \"Rebecca\" / Courtesy of EMK Musical Company By Pyo Kyung-min Poster for the musical \"Rebecca\" / Courtesy of EMK Musical Company Entering its remarkable 10th year on stage, the musical \"Rebecca\" has achieved a significant milestone by captivating more than 1 million viewers in Korea. Originating from Daphne du Maurier's classic novel and reinvented by Alfred Hitchcock's film, the musical has been a staple in Korea's theater scene since its premiere in 2013. After attracting more than 950,000 viewers across its first six seasons, the production crossed the 1 million audience mark in its 10th year. Set in the grand Manderley mansion, the musical revolves around Maxim de Winter, an English gentleman haunted by the memory of his late wife Rebecca, and \"I,\" an unnamed narrator who falls in love with Maxim. After a fateful encounter at a resort, their love story takes a dark turn upon their return to Manderley, where they are greeted by the disturbing presence of Mrs. Danvers, the mansion's long-serving butler. A scene from the musical \"Rebecca\" featuring Shin Young-sook, who plays Mrs. Danvers / Courtesy of EMK Musical Company During Wednesday's performance, singer and musical actress Lisa's portrayal of Mrs. Danvers and Kim Bo-Kyung's reprisal of her role as \"I\" particularly captivated the audience. The musical keeps its audience enthralled with a perfect mix of engaging plots that blend romance and thriller elements, complemented by beautiful songs that enrich the experience. Especially noteworthy is Mrs. Danvers' show-stopping performance of \"Rebecca II,\" which serves as the show's climactic moment. The lingering impact of her rich mid-to-low notes blending into the electrifying high ones continues to strike a chord with the audience long even after the final curtain falls. Lisa showed her charismatic stage presence. Her bone-chilling vocal performance, driven by her character's intense disdain for \"I,\" left the audience with no option but to burst into applause. Kim boasted her impeccable vocal and acting skills, warming the hearts of many. The theater came alive with the exquisite melodies of \"Time in a Bottle,\" sung by Kim in the throes of love for Maxim. A scene from the musical \"Rebecca\" featuring Kim Bo-Kyung, who plays \"I\" / Courtesy of EMK Musical Company The song \"Never Was a Smile That Cold,\" a haunting reflection by Maxim on Rebecca's mysterious death, also pleased the audiences' ears. Maxim was played by Tei this day. Tei's portrayal of Maxim was a perfect embodiment of the genteel Englishman, dispelling any doubts about his background as a singer. He seamlessly conveyed the anguish of the mansion's heir, complementing his performance with clear and emotionally resonant vocals. He also displayed his stage etiquette during the curtain call, acknowledging each audience member and expressing his heartfelt gratitude. A scene from the musical \"Rebecca\" / Courtesy of EMK Musical Company This season, marking its 10th anniversary, introduces new talent to the ensemble. Singer Tei, actor Lee Ji-soo and Red Velvet member Wendy join the stage alongside veteran actors Ryu Jung-han, Shin Young-sook and Ok Joo-hyun. The performance's standout feature also includes impressive stagecraft. The highlights are the rotating stage, smoothly transitioning between the mansion's interior and exterior and the remarkably realistic portrayal of the mansion's fiery demise. \"Rebecca\" is staged at Blue Square theater in central Seoul, through Nov. 19.",

      "content": "Jurgen Klinsmann, center, head coach of the South Korean men's football team, speaks to reporters at Incheon International Airport, west of Seoul, Thursday. Yonhap Korea men's football head coach Jurgen Klinsmann has shrugged off a fair amount of criticism against him over his six-month tenure, ranging from his perceived lack of commitment to his inability to bring out the best in players with tactical brilliance. But when some vile stuff found its way to his family, Klinsmann had a rare emotional response. After Korea's goalless draw against Wales in Cardiff last Thursday, Klinsmann approached Welsh captain Aaron Ramsey to ask for his shirt. Players typically swap their jerseys after international matches as a sign of mutual respect. Klinsmann later told British media that his son Jonathan, goalkeeper for LA Galaxy in Major League Soccer, had specifically asked for Ramsey's uniform. In most other circumstances, it could have been regarded as a simple gesture of a father trying to come through for his son. However, the draw extended Korea's winless skid to five matches to begin Klinsmann's tenure. Coming as it did after an uninspired performance, Klinsmann's action drew a lot of heat from the angry Korean fans who felt he didn't appear to take the result all that seriously. Klinsmann further addressed the situation Thursday after returning to Korea from England, where Korea defeated Saudi Arabia 1-0 on Tuesday for his first win in charge of the Taegeuk Warriors. Much-criticized Klinsmann asks for help in building 'positive spirit' for nat'l team 2023-09-14 19:58 | Sports \"It was for the physical therapist of my son's team in Los Angeles,\" Klinsmann said of Ramsey's shirt. A national team official said the physical therapist is from Wales. \"But to be honest, I don't understand why this would be a reason to criticize something,\" Klinsmann added, shaking his head. \"My son got critical comments on his Instagram, which is absolutely stupid.\" Klinsmann handled other questions about the team and about his work habits in typical fashion, with a smile and occasional jokes. He had initially planned to stay put in Europe to watch Korean internationals there but made a last-minute change to travel back to Korea. He plans to watch matches in the domestic K League this weekend, a decision likely reached after Klinsmann had been panned for not spending enough time in his host country. Pressed for the reason for his about-face, Klinsmann nodded toward the media with a smile and said, \"Because you asked for it.\" (Yonhap)",

      "content": "Jangchung High School pitcher Hwang Jun-seo speaks after being selected first overall by the Hanwha Eagles at the Korea Baseball Organization draft in Seoul, Thursday. Yonhap Jangchung High School left-hander Hwang Jun-seo went first overall at the annual amateur draft for the Korea Baseball Organization (KBO) on Thursday. With their No. 1 pick, the Hanwha Eagles selected the 18-year-old pitcher out of the Seoul-based school. In 15 appearances this year, Hwang went 6-2 with a 2.16 ERA in 49 2/3 innings. He struck out 58 and walked 16. Over his three years in high school, Hwang has compiled a 9-4 record with a 1.93 ERA in 112 1/3 innings. He recorded 132 strikeouts against 34 walks. \"Our scouts have been really high on Hwang Jun-seo throughout the year,\" Eagles general manager Son Hyuk said. \"He is the type of pitcher that every team wants.\" The competition for the first overall pick became wide open last month after Masan Yongma High School right-hander Jang Hyun-seok, considered the consensus No. 1 pick, decided to skip the KBO draft so he could sign with the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Hanwha Eagles had the first overall pick after finishing in last place in 2022. The draft order was determined by the reverse order of finish last season. \"I can't believe I've been picked first. My hands are shaking right now,\" Hwang said after putting on the orange Eagles jersey on the stage. \"I want to develop into a player that the team will turn to in tough situations. But more so than any personal goals, I want to help the team win a championship.\" Hwang said he'd like to start in the KBO but added, \"No matter what the team asks me to do, I will pitch the best I can.\" Hwang, who can touch 150 kilometers per hour with his fastball, said San Diego Padres closer Josh Hader, famous for his hard fastball and devastating slider, is his role model. The Doosan Bears, picking second, chose Incheon High School right-hander Kim Taek-yeon. In 13 appearances this year, Kim pitched to a 7-1 record and a 1.13 ERA in 64 1/3 innings. He struck out 97 and walked nine batters. Over his three years in high school, Kim went 11-2 with a 1.34 ERA in 120 2/3 innings. He recorded 173 strikeouts against 26 walks. Both Hwang and Kim helped South Korea win bronze at the World Baseball Softball Confederation U-18 Baseball World Cup in Chinese Taipei earlier this month. Kim pitched a complete game shutout against the United States in the bronze medal game Sunday. It was Kim's sixth appearance of the tournament. He allowed only two earned runs in 16 innings for a 0.88 ERA, while striking out 29 and walking only four. Kim was a perfect 2-0. Hwang went 1-2 with a 3.97 ERA in 12 1/3 innings over three outings. He struck out 15 and walked three. Bears general manager Kim Tae-ryong spoke highly of Kim Taek-yeon's consistency. \"He can command all of his pitches well without compromising his velocity,\" the executive said. \"Within two or three years, we expect him to become our closer.\" With a slew of hard-throwing young fireballers, nine of the first 10 selections were high school pitchers. Defending champions SSG Landers selected infielder Park Ji-hwan with the 10th pick. Among others players of note, pitcher Jin Yoo-young, one-time prospect in the Kansas City Royals system, went No. 38 overall to the LG Twins. In all, 110 out of 1,083 players who entered the draft were selected. Of those 110, 27 were college players, up from 18 in 2022. (Yonhap)",

      "content": "Korean fencer Gu Bon-gil trains for the Hangzhou Asian Games at the National Training Center in Jincheon, North Chungcheong Province, Aug. 24. Yonhap Having earlier served as Korea's flag bearer at an Olympic Games, sabre fencer Gu Bon-gil said Wednesday he is \"honored\" to take on the same role for the Asian Games later this month. The Korean Sport Olympic Committee (KSOC) on Tuesday named Gu and swimmer Kim Seo-yeong as the Korean flag bearers at the opening ceremony for the Hangzhou Asiad, scheduled for Sept. 23. Gu had also carried the national flag, Taegeukgi, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. The KSOC keeps information on flag bearers at multisport competitions dating back to the 1982 Asian Games. According to its data, Gu will be just the second athlete to be a flag bearer at both the Olympics and the Asian Games, joining former handball star Yoon Kyung-shin in the exclusive company. Yoon flew the flag at the 2010 Guangzhou Asian Games and then the 2012 London Olympics. Korean fencer Gu Bon-gil poses before a training session for the Hangzhou Asian Games at the National Training Center in Jincheon, North Chungcheong Province, Aug. 24. Yonhap \"For us athletes, the Olympics and the Asian Games are the most important events, and it's a huge honor for me to be the flag bearer while representing the country,\" Gu said. \"I am grateful for this opportunity. I am also happy to share this record with Yoon Kyung-shin, who is a legend in his sport.\" Yoon is widely regarded as the greatest Korean male handball player ever, with five Asian Games gold medals to his credit. He was the 2001 International Handball Federation World Player of the Year, and led all players in scoring at the 2004 Summer Olympics, and the 1993, 1995 and 1997 world championships. Gu, 34, is no slouch. He has also won five Asian Games gold medals, along with two Olympic gold medals and four world titles in the men's sabre event. Gu will be going for his fourth consecutive men's sabre individual gold medal in Hangzhou. If Gu sweeps up both the individual and team gold medals this fall, he will end up with a record seven Asiad gold medals. Korean fencer Gu Bon-gil speaks during a joint press conference at a media day event at the Jincheon National Training Center in Jincheon, North Chungcheong Province, Aug. 24, marking the 30-day countdown to the Hangzhou Asian Games. Yonhap Three athletes are currently tied for first place in that category with six gold medals apiece, including former fencer Nam Hyun-hee. \"Back at the Rio Olympics, I felt a lot of pressure to be the flag bearer, and it meant a lot to me and to my family,\" Gu said. \"Now that I've done it once, I know what it feels like. And more importantly, I will try to put up great results in the competition.\" As for his chances of winning his fourth consecutive gold in the individual event, Gu quipped, \"You know, I am the prince of Asia in fencing.\" \"Physically, I am feeling great. At this point, it's more about being mentally strong than about working on technique,\" Gu added. \"I know I have a lot of history at stake this time. An opportunity like this doesn't come often, and I am going to bear down and make the most of that.\" (Yonhap)",

Yonhap Jurgen Klinsmann, beleaguered head coach of the South Korean men's national football team, is set to return to Seoul this week after a recent European trip following a last-minute schedule change, officials said Wednesday. The Korea Football Association (KFA) announced Klinsmann will return to South Korea with the rest of the home-based members of the national team Thursday afternoon. The Taegeuk Warriors played two friendly matches in Europe this month, with a goalless draw against Wales last Thursday in Cardiff followed by a 1-0 squeaker over Saudi Arabia on Tuesday in Newcastle, England. It was Klinsmann's first win as South Korea's bench boss. Klinsmann had initially planned to stay put in Europe to check on South Korean internationals plying their trade there before returning to South Korea. His initial itinerary included a trip to Germany to watch Bayern Munich's South Korean defender Kim Min-jae at the weekend. However, following a meeting with his backroom staff Wednesday, Klinsmann decided to return to South Korea immediately, according to the KFA. Klinsmann will check on players in the domestic K League before putting together the next edition of the national team for the October international match window, the KFA added. South Korea will host Tunisia on Oct. 13 and Vietnam on Oct. 17. (Yonhap)",

      "content": "Kim Soo-ja's \"Beyond the Forest\" is drawn with the simple yet profound medium of colored pencils. Courtesy of the artist By Kwon Mee-yoo In an era where the hustle and bustle caused by social network services fills our days, Kim Soo-ja, an illustrator whose career dates back 40 years, invites visitors to pause and reflect on at her latest exhibition \"Concentric Circles.\" The exhibit, running through Sept. 20 at Gallery Dam in central Seoul, presents 26 artworks Kim created with her simple yet profound medium of choice ― colored pencils ― to share her personal journey through illness and recovery. Commonly seen as the first step for children into the world of art, colored pencils actually have a history that go back to ancient Greece. Kim finds a connection between the simplicity of colored pencils and her own approach to art and uses these ancient drawing tools to erase the \"stains\" left by the fast-paced digital era. Kim's works, mostly on circular canvas, are results of countless hand movements, painstakingly crafted to give a glimpse of the \"essence of life beyond the tangible world.\" Her artistic presence serves as a counterpoint to the noise and shallowness of the digital era. Artist Kim Soo-ja poses with her artworks at her latest exhibition, \"Concentric Circles,\" which runs through Sept. 20 at Gallery Dam in central Seoul. Courtesy of the artist This exhibition holds a special place in Kim's life, as it comes after her battle with cancer. The pain and suffering she endured have enriched her art, breathing a sense of peace and healing into her works. Kim noted how the COVID-19 pandemic, along with her illness, forced her to reevaluate her life. Drawing inspiration from French writer Laurence Devillairs and Mexican poet Octavio Paz, she emphasized the importance of listening to one's inner voice and focusing on the present. \"Now is the time to pay all our attention to the voices from within, distancing ourselves from the noise of the high-tech era based on materials and speed,\" Kim said in a statement. The artist hopes her paintings offer viewers the same sense of comfort and consolation. \"Like a tiny seed that gives out sprouts, like the water that runs without interruption, like the wind that is never blocked, like a stone that rolls freely hither and thither, like the music that brushes against my ear, like the echo that flies across the boundaries, my thoughts go farther and farther like ever-expanding concentric circles,\" she said. \"During the whole time I was working on my paintings, I could remain unperturbed and experience peace of the faraway horizon. I hope my paintings will offer consolation to the viewers as they did to me.\" Installation view of Kim Soo-ja's exhibition \"Concentric Circles\" at Gallery Dam / Courtesy of the artist Kim's artistic journey has evolved over the years, reflecting her changing perspectives on civilization and humanity. Her 1995 \"TV-People\" exhibition questioned the relationship between civilization and humanity. Since the early 2000s, she has focused on translating poetry into paintings and her previous exhibitions, such as \"Illustration Essay-Blue,\" \"Road to Insa-dong,\" \"Drawing Poetry,\" \"My Beautiful Garden\" and \"Walk around Seoul,\" have explored various facets of beauty and life.",

      "content": "This Aug. 20, 2018 file photo shows North Korean weightlifter Ri Song-gum competing in the women's 48 kg weightlifting event at the Jakarta-Palembang 2018 Asian Games. Yonhap North Korea has 191 athletes signed up for the Asian Games starting next week, according to organizers, suggesting the country is poised to end its more than three-year isolation from the global sporting arena. North Koreans are listed on the Games' website for accredited media to compete in the Chinese city of Hangzhou in sports including athletics, gymnastics, basketball, football, boxing and weightlifting. North Koreans were similarly down to compete at a weightlifting tournament in Cuba in June, but they failed to show. North Korea closed its already tight borders in early 2020 following the outbreak of the pandemic and skipped the Tokyo Olympics, which were pushed back to 2021 because of COVID. It was then banned by the International Olympic Committee from the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics for failing to take part in Tokyo. There have been recent signs that the border restrictions have been eased slightly, with a taekwondo team allowed to travel to a competition last month in Kazakhstan. Prior to that, North Korea had not sent any of its domestic athletes to overseas competitions since the pandemic. The sporting action at the Games in Hangzhou starts on Sept. 19, four days before the opening ceremony, with North Korea scheduled to face Taiwan in men's football that day. Leader Kim Jong-un is said to be an avid sports fan and Games hosts China are North Korea's longtime ally and main economic benefactor. This Aug. 19, 2018 file photo shows North Korean freestyle wrestler Kang Kum-song, right, competing against a Mongolian player in the men's 57 kg at the Jakarta-Palembang 2018 Asian Games. Yonhap North Korea has traditionally been especially strong in weightlifting, dominating the event at the Jakarta Asian Games in 2018 with eight golds. Ri Song-gum and Rim Un-sim, who both won gold in the women's weightlifting five years ago, are scheduled to appear in Hangzhou. But North Korea has also been among the countries punished for doping in the sport, including what governing body the IWF called \"multiple positive cases\" in qualification for the 2016 Rio Olympics. The Asian Games feature about 12,200 competitors in total ― more than the Olympics ― and end on Oct. 8. (AFP)",

      "content": "Foldables are the latest trend in the smartphone industry. They might be fragile, but foldables are exciting. like the Galaxy Z Flip 5, even if I don’t intend to switch to Android for one. More interesting to me are larger foldables, which can become tablets or PCs. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. By signing up, I agree to the and have reviewed the Since I’m deeply entrenched in the Apple ecosystem, I am waiting for a foldable iPad or Mac to arrive. One that’s done right. While I wait, the first foldable PC that might be done right is already here: the HP Spectre Fold. But it also comes with a hefty price tag of $4,999.99. That starting price tells us what the biggest problem with foldable PCs is. It’s expensive to manufacture attractive, large, foldable devices. Even more costly than making foldable smartphones. And a foldable PC is definitely a risky purchase, no matter how exciting it might be. The Spectre Fold is HP’s first foldable, but it’s not the world’s first. It started with the , which debuted for $2,499 a few years ago. Then Asus made the $3,499 . HP that its Spectre Fold is the world’s thinnest and smallest 17-inch foldable PC. That checks my “done right” box. I don’t want a bulky PC, especially one that becomes a tablet. The HP Spectre Fold weighs only 3 pounds, which is impressive. Also, it makes me worry about its integrity. I also want it to be thick enough so the battery can deliver enough energy. On that front, HP says that the Spectre Fold can last up to 12 hours in laptop mode and up to 11 hours in desktop mode. It’s not M1/M2 MacBook Air battery life, but it still sounds good. In practice, you might not get that maximum battery life. Speaking of modes, the 17-inch tablet becomes a 17-inch PC if you use the built-in stand to prop up the tablet. There’s no folding involved in either of these modes. But you can fold the 17-inch tablet into a 12.3-inch laptop. You will need the keyboard accessor to make it work as a “one-and-a-half screen” laptop. It’s the keyboard you pair with the laptop in desktop mode. Or you can use both screens when folding the tablet in this 12.3-inch laptop mode. When it comes to specs, you’re looking at a 17-inch OLED screen, 12th Gen Intel Core i7 processor, Intel Iris Xe graphics, 16GB of memory, 1TB SSD, 2 USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports, Wi-Fi 6E support, and a 5-megapixel camera. There’s also wireless charging support for the keyboard. That is also the world’s first for the Spectre Fold. As is the built-in AI support for security, wellness, and gesture controls: An advanced AI chip adapts to your needs, delivering a tailored computing experience that focuses on you. Enjoy features such as walk away lock, wake on approach, auto screen dimming, and privacy alerts to enhance your privacy. Screen time and distance reminders, along with touch-free content control, help you focus on wellbeing while providing a more intuitive interaction with the device. Microsoft has built the Copilot AI assistant into Windows 11, but the features above probably have nothing to do with that. HP created them for the Spectre Fold. All of that sounds pretty great, I’ll give HP that. What I won’t give the PC maker is $4,999.99. The Spectre Fold is available for preorder from . It should ship on October 5th. HP will take orders on its website next month as well. Furthermore, the Spectre Fold will reach international markets this fall.",

      "content": "NASA said Thursday that the study of UFOs will require new scientific techniques, including advanced satellites as well as a shift in how unidentified flying objects are perceived. The space agency released the findings after a yearlong study into UFOs. In its 33-page report, an independent team commissioned by NASA cautioned that the negative perception surrounding UFOs poses an obstacle to collecting data. But officials said NASA's involvement should help reduce the stigma around what it calls UAPs, or unidentified anomalous phenomena. \"We want to shift the conversation about UAPs from sensationalism to science,\" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said. He promised an open and transparent approach. Officials stressed the panel found no evidence that UAPs had extraterrestrial origin. But Nelson acknowledged with billions of stars in billions of galaxies out there, another Earth could exist. \"If you ask me, do I believe there's life in a universe that is so vast that it's hard for me to comprehend how big it is, my personal answer is yes,\" Nelson said at a news conference. His own scientists put the likelihood of life on another Earth-like planet at \"at least a trillion.\" When pressed by reporters on whether the U.S. or other governments are hiding aliens or otherworldly spaceships, Nelson said: \"Show me the evidence.\" NASA has said it doesn't actively search for unexplained sightings. But it operates a fleet of Earth-circling spacecraft that can help determine, for example, whether weather is behind a strange event. The 16-member panel noted that artificial intelligence and machine learning are essential for identifying rare occurrences, including UFOs. NASA recently appointed a director for UFO research, but is not divulging the identity to protect them from the kind of threats and harassment faced by the panel members during the study. \"That's in part why we are not splashing the name of our new director out there because science needs to be free. Science needs to undergo a real and rigorous and rational process, and you need the freedom of thought to be able to do that,\" said Dan Evans, NASA's liaison with the panel. No top-secret files were accessed by the scientists, aviation and artificial intelligence experts, and retired NASA astronaut Scott Kelly, the first American to spend nearly a year in space. Instead, the group relied on unclassified data in an attempt to better understand unexplained sightings in the sky. Officials said there are so few high-quality observations that no scientific conclusions can be drawn. Most events can be attributed to planes, drones, balloons or weather conditions, said panel chairman David Spergel, president of the Simons Foundation, a scientific research group. The government refers to unexplained sightings as UAPs versus UFOs. NASA defines them as observations in the sky or elsewhere that cannot be readily identified or scientifically explained. The study was launched a year ago and cost under $100,000.",

The very first on-air painting from the “The Joy of Painting” is looking for a new owner after being kept safe for decades by one of the show’s early volunteers. “A Walk in the Woods” was painted live on-air in January of 1983, and typifies everything the public came to love about Ross and his art-positive mission. It depicts a placid woodland scene in shades of gold and blue, painted with Ross’ preferred “ ” technique, with deceptively complex-looking brushstrokes and, of course, an abundance of happy little trees. In the lower lefthand corner, Ross’ signature stands out in red. The work was acquired by Minneapolis-based art gallery Modern Artifact earlier this year. Before that, it was owned by a one-time volunteer at the Falls Church, Virginia PBS station where the first season of “The Joy of Painting” was aired. The volunteer bought it in November of 1983 at a station fundraising auction, just months after it was painted. It has been verified as authentic by . Modern Artifact owner Ryan Nelson said Ross’ work has seen increasing demand over the years. “The driving force behind the increased demand for Bob Ross paintings seems to be collectors themselves,” Nelson said in a statement. “Nostalgia, social media and an increased interest by the general public in the personality behind the art have all contributed to his current popularity.” The gallery is offering the painting at a price point of $9.85 million, but Nelson says it’s in no rush to sell. “It’s a truly irreplicable, one-of-a-kind painting,” he said. “Ideally, we would like to share it with a museum or traveling exhibit to allow as many people as possible to view such an exciting work of art.” “The Joy of Painting,” which aired on PBS from 1983 to 1994, has become a wholesome classic in league with fellow PBS show “Mister Roger’s Neighborhood.” Even now, 40 years after it first aired, people still watch old episodes and . Ross himself also became an icon for his kind, positive instruction and his belief that anyone could make beautiful art. “I think there’s an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us,” Ross of the first episode of “The Joy of Painting,” minutes before getting started on the work that now holds so much value for so many. “I hope you have your brush ready, and a dream in your heart.”",

The volunteer bought it in November of 1983 at a station fundraising auction, just months after it was painted. It has been verified as authentic by . Modern Artifact owner Ryan Nelson said Ross’ work has seen increasing demand over the years. “The driving force behind the increased demand for Bob Ross paintings seems to be collectors themselves,” Nelson said in a statement. “Nostalgia, social media and an increased interest by the general public in the personality behind the art have all contributed to his current popularity.” The gallery is offering the painting at a price point of $9.85 million, but Nelson says it’s in no rush to sell. “It’s a truly irreplicable, one-of-a-kind painting,” he said. “Ideally, we would like to share it with a museum or traveling exhibit to allow as many people as possible to view such an exciting work of art.” “The Joy of Painting,” which aired on PBS from 1983 to 1994, has become a wholesome classic in league with fellow PBS show “Mister Roger’s Neighborhood.” Even now, 40 years after it first aired, people still watch old episodes and . Ross himself also became an icon for his kind, positive instruction and his belief that anyone could make beautiful art. “I think there’s an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us,” Ross of the first episode of “The Joy of Painting,” minutes before getting started on the work that now holds so much value for so many. “I hope you have your brush ready, and a dream in your heart.”",

      "content": "MILWAUKEE — This hidden gem offers a magical trip into the world of Harry Potter. From the outside, this unassuming Bay View bungalow gives no clue to what you’ll find inside. But the owner, Lauren Andrews, says that’s typical of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. I went inside to experience Harry’s Hideaway and meet the woman who imagined it. “It’s a passion project to merge my love of interior design and hosting into a charming home, all themed on the Harry Potter movies,” said Lauren. Every space in the two-bedroom, one-bath short-term rental is beautifully decorated to portray aspects of Harry Potter’s world. From the bedroom with wallpaper of books dedicated to all the books that are mentioned throughout the Harry Potter books, to the bathroom with a snake mirror and antique light fixtures reminiscent of 12 Grimmauld Place. Not to mention the secret entrances, which look like normal entrances, so they're hidden from the Muggles (non-magical humans). Lauren feels that those familiar with the movies will get the references, while others will appreciate the beauty. “We live in a world that's very contentious and divisive, and dark at times, so I wanted to do something that brought a little magic and a little joy into your everyday life. That's how Harry's Hideaway was born,\" said Lauren This hidden gem is perfect for a staycation, hosting out-of-town visitors, a short-term rental, and Potter Heads. And according to Lauren, it’s the only one of its kind in our area. //",

Online dangers are growing with our love of online shopping. In fact, 79% of U.S. consumers say that they shop online more frequently now than they did before the COVID-19 pandemic . Although, it also has some risks and challenges, especially when it comes to paying with your credit card. How can you tell if a website is trustworthy and secure for online payments? What does it mean when a website has HTTP or HTTPS in its web address? How does it affect your online security and privacy ? We'll get to those questions. Let's start by answering this one from Margaret from Fort Lauderdale, Florida. \"Does https mean the site takes credit cards and http is okay if they don’t take credit cards?\" – Margaret Jane, Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Margaret Jane raises an excellent question. Let's go over the difference between \"HTTP\" and \"HTTPS\" and whether it matters or not when you're paying with a credit card online.

The difference between HTTP and HTTPS is that HTTPS uses a SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) certificate to encrypt all data transfer while HTTP is not secured with an SSL certificate and is much more open to hackers stealing sensitive information. HTTPS is internet security geek-speak for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, and it functions similarly to HTTP, except that it works to protect communication between web servers and browsers when transporting data. A website that begins with HTTP does not have this same layer of protection . It’s all about the letter \"S\" In the simplest of terms, imagine you are sending a letter to your friend through the mail. HTTP is like sending a letter in a normal envelope. It is not very secure, and anyone who intercepts the letter can open it and read your message. HTTPS is like sending a letter in a locked envelope. It is very secure, and only you and the recipient can open it and read your message. Why is HTTPS more secure than HTTP? HTTPS is more secure than HTTP because it uses an SSL certificate to encrypt the data that is transferred between the web server and the browser. This means that anyone who tries to intercept or tamper with the data will not be able to read or modify it. How HTTPS protects your data with SSL certificates MORE: DON’T FALL FOR THIS NEW BANKING SCAM SSL certificates also verify the identity of the website, so you can be sure that you are dealing with a legitimate site and not a fake one. An SSL certificate is a digital document that contains information about the website, such as its domain name, owner and expiration date. It also has a public key and a private key, which are used to encrypt and decrypt data. The public key is shared with anyone who wants to communicate with the website while the private key is kept secret by the website owner. How your browser verifies and encrypts data with HTTPS When you visit a website that uses HTTPS, your browser will check the SSL certificate and make sure that it is valid and matches the website’s domain name. If everything is OK, your browser will establish a secure connection with the website and exchange encryption keys. Then, all the data that is sent and received will be encrypted using these keys. How to identify HTTPS websites in your browser You can tell if a website is using HTTPS by looking at the web address in your browser. MORE: HOW THIS SAFE BROWSING FEATURE IS USING AI TO STAY AHEAD OF SCAMMERS If it starts with http s ://, then it means the website is secure. You may also see a padlock icon or a green bar next to the web address, which indicates the website has a valid SSL certificate. Why you should avoid paying with credit cards on HTTP websites Whether a site takes credit cards or not has nothing to do with whether it uses HTTP or HTTPS. However, if a site does take credit cards, it’s important that it uses HTTP S to protect the sensitive information being transferred. If you're on a website that uses HTTP, and it's telling you to pay for something with a credit card, you should probably steer clear of it. The website could be a phishing page or be infected with some sort of malware that could hand your credit card information over to a hacker, and then they could do whatever they want with it.

      "content": "Paying for a subscription to a service like is one way to make sure you always have something to do in your free time, when you’re perhaps looking for mindless entertainment to veg out to along the lines of — or when you want a compelling new Netflix series to sink your teeth into, something like or the new crime drama (one of my personal favorites at the moment). Lately, though, I’ve found myself spending more and more time going down a very specific Netflix rabbit hole: Using massive catalog of to augment my (so far, feeble) attempts to learn the Spanish language. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. By signing up, I agree to the and have reviewed the One of the best ways to learn a new language, you’ll hear over and over, is to watch and movies that feature native speakers. Given how much of a global behemoth Netflix has become, this is something that the streaming giant has in spades. Some of its best, most exciting, and highest-quality original content, in fact, is its international programming. Examples include the wildly popular Korean Netflix series , the Swedish crime drama , and the Norweigan drama — which just released its third and final season, with a hugely controversial reveal at the end. Must-watch Spanish Netflix series It should go without saying, of course, that watching these kinds of series isn’t a magic bullet that will supercharge your language skill all by itself. It is, however, a great way to augment whatever else you’re already doing, like taking a class or using a language-learning app on your phone. Watching Netflix series like, in my case, the Spanish-language titles below will definitely give you an opportunity to hear how the language is used by native speakers in everyday conversation — which is so important as you continue learning, no matter what language you’re studying. In no particular order, here are some of my favorite Spanish-language Netflix series that anyone learning the language should consider checking out. Also known by its Spanish name of La Casa de Papel, this five-season crime drama is one of the biggest Netflix series of all time (per , based on hours viewed over the course of each season’s first month of availability). As for what it’s about, the plot is built around what starts as a straightforward heist narrative, masterminded by a brilliant professor who wants to pull off the biggest theft in recorded history — by breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing billions of euros. This next Netflix series — which, coincidentally, comes from the creators of — found itself on my radar because of the cast, including Lali Esposito, an actress/singer/dancer who’s sort of like the Lady Gaga of Argentina (home to my favorite rock band of all time). The show, the plot of which is driven by three sex workers who decide to flee their maniacal pimp, has a kinetic visual flair reminiscent of a Tarantino movie and bombards you with guns, beautiful women, stolen cash, drugs, and cartoonishly evil bad guys. Based on the best-selling novel of the same name by Javier Castillo that sold more than 1 million copies in Spain, the Netflix series (aka ), is a 6-episode drama set in the Spanish port city of Malaga — a locale filled with resorts and high-rises, with the story taking place during the city’s Three Wise Men parade in 2010. A young girl disappears during what’s supposed to be a happy event, and a trainee journalist subsequently rises to the imperatives of her profession. She launches her own investigation, with the help of a journalist colleague, alongside that of an inspector — an investigation that promises to awaken aspects of her past she’d rather forget. “The best trait of an investigative reporter,” a group of students is told at one point during the series, “is tenacity. The urge to put things in their place, however hard it may seem.” Netflix crime dramas don’t get bloodier, more savage, and more addictive than Narcos and its spinoff, Narcos: Mexico. The former tracked the rise and spectacular fall of the infamous Colombian drug kingpin Pablo Escobar, while the latter shifted the narrative to Mexico to focus on a much savvier and more business-minded druglord, Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo. Transport the warring rivalries of to the badlands of Latin America — and throw in bricks of cocaine, along with lots and lots of guns — and what you’re left with is more or less the franchise. A tour-de-force of storytelling and world-building from Netflix, and one of its most indispensable dramas. Fans of no-frills crime dramas should find this next Netflix series quite an easy drama to dive into. , created by Aitor Gabilondo and David Bermejo, first aired on the Telecinco channel in Spain as , and then made its Netflix debut in May of 2022 with its English title. Bermejo and Gabilondo previously collaborated on , which also starred José Coronado. There’s a sort of Clint Eastwood vibe to the angry, fed-up war veteran who’s the protagonist of this story. When his teenage granddaughter falls in with a bad crowd — specifically, the drug dealers overtaking his Madrid neighborhood — he takes it upon himself to both go after them and to reform the girl. If you let yourself get really invested in learning a new language, it’s more likely than not that it will open the door to so much more beyond just the language study itself — to encompass everything from the culture’s food, movies, books, TV shows, and the like. That’s what Spanish has done for me, specifically as it relates to music; I mentioned earlier that my favorite band of all time is from Argentina, as is the real-life central figure in , which dramatizes the life and career of Latin American rock pioneer Fito Paez. The 8-episode series (the Spanish title of which is ) delivers a Bohemian Rhapsody-style epic treatment of one of the most essential Argentine musicians of all time — in addition to including portrayals of Charly Garcia, Luis Alberto Spinetta, Fabiana Cantilo, and Juan Carlos Baglietto. Last but not least, we come to this delightful coming-of-age series from Colombia, the Spanish title of which is (“The First Time”). Moreover, I also think that this 13-episode series, perhaps more than any other on this list, may be the most universal, given that it’s built around growing pains and a teenage love story. And I’m so happy that Netflix is bringing it back for another season. From the streamer’s official synopsis:",

Following Sep 14, 2023, 07:35pm EDT | Press play to listen to this article! Got it! Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Topline Former President Donald Trump said in an NBC interview snippet he could have pardoned himself before departing the White House in 2021 and that it’s “very unlikely” he’ll pardon himself if elected president again, referencing four indictments he faces that will likely conclude after the next presidential election. The NBC interview with Trump will air in full on Sunday. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images) Getty Images Key Facts The snippet, which is from an interview with new Meet the Press moderator Kristen Welker that will air in full Sunday, featured the former president saying he wouldn’t pardon himself because he believes he has done nothing to warrant the indictments against him. Trump claimed in his last day of office, he could have somehow pardoned himself and avoided “fake charges” he said were levied by the Biden Administration—though the former president’s first indictment didn’t materialize until more than two years after he left office. Trump recalled telling lawyers, “The last thing I’d ever do is give myself a pardon,” noting in the NBC interview that such a move would have made him look “terrible,” though he did not completely rule it out. Tangent Trump chimed in on the news of Hunter Biden’s indictment on three federal gun charges Thursday, maintaining his repeated stance that there are two justice systems—one that berates him and one that favors President Joe Biden and his colleagues. He called the president’s son’s plea agreement, which fell through more than a month ago and could have helped Biden avoid some of the charges, “the deal of the century.” Key Background Trump’s four indictments include a total of 91 federal and state charges against him that would equate to $11.2 million in fines if he were convicted of every one. The indictments include a case alleging hush-money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels, a separate federal case that Trump mishandled classified national defense documents, another federal case alleging Trump attempted to overturn the 2020 presidential election and a state-level case accusing him of attempting to overturn his electoral defeat in Georgia. Since they involve state-level charges, Trump could not pardon himself in the hush-money or Georgia cases even if again elected president.

      "content": "Forbes Lifestyle ForbesLife Why German Spätburgunder Is The Pinot Noir You Should Be Drinking Lauren Mowery Contributor Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. I cover drinks, travel and food, and the intersection of all three. Following Sep 14, 2023, 05:39pm EDT | Press play to listen to this article! Got it! Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Lauren Mowery tasting Spätburgunder in Wiesbaden Lauren Mowery In late August, I joined colleagues from around the world in Wiesbaden, Germany, for the 2023 preview of the VDP. Grosses Gewächs (GG) top dry wines. The tasting showcased a range of varieties, from Lemberger, Sylvaner, Weissburgunder to Spätburgunder and an extensive roster of Riesling. I reviewed nearly 300 of the 471 wines on the docket in three days. Though I missed a few entries, much of what I tasted proved thrilling, especially Spätburgunder. I orchestrated my first deep dive into German Pinot Noir (Spätburgunder means ‘late Burgundy’ in reference to its ripening time and origin), for an article in The SOMM Journal in 2015. Back then, samples were hard to find and few retailers and sommeliers, even in New York City, had much to say about the category, let alone proffer compliments. Even the Mosel Valley grows Pinot Noir. View of Bremm at the Mosel with Moselschleife getty As a wine writer—and former editor of Fordham’s Environmental Law Journal—I’ve followed climate change closely for two decades. I suspected that Spätburgunder would be a category to watch. Indeed, the wines have blossomed into noble challengers to their neighbors in nearby Burgundy, France, though at what cost to the country’s filigreed whites—is an article for another moment. Today, Spätburgunder flourishes in each of Germany's 13 quality wine regions, covering a combined area of approximately 28,880 acres throughout the country. This positions Germany's as the third-largest global producer of Pinot Noir , following France with around 79,070 acres and the United States with 61,750 acres under cultivation.

Baden, typically Germany’s warmest growing region, suffered late spring frosts and icy winds which damaged up to 80 percent of young wet buds in some vineyards, according to the Wines of Germany 2021 vintage report . The small, northern region of Ahr experienced a devastating flood in July, though the most attentive of growers recovered, turning out wines of delicacy and finesse. During the preview, many 2021s reflected the chillier conditions with a throughline of freshness and tension at the expense of concentration and power. For example, 2020 was a hotter, drought-afflicted vintage that nevertheless imbued reds with more muscle and alcohol. Spätburgunder harvested in 2019 enjoyed an exceptionally balanced vintage for ripeness and brightness. Despite varying degrees of vintage variation, however, German Spätburgunder has never been better, and it should be the Pinot Noir you’re seeking to drink. Due to time constraints and varied interests, I did not make it through all of the Spätburgunder available to taste. The 18 listed below reflect a few of my favorites. Wines to Find: 18 Spätburgunder Grosses Gewächs VDP Grosse Lagen Rudolf Fürst, Klingenberg Schlossberg, Franken, 2021, Score: 93 An aromatic, enticing nose of sour red cherry and baking spice follows through to the silky, bright palate. Burgundian in its elegance and complexity, exuberant fruit and a touch of minerality shows good concentration while remaining elegant and delicate. Outstanding. Zehnthof Theo Luckert, Sulzfeld Maustal, Franken, 2020, Score: 93 Currants and confected cherry aromas introduce the spicy, juicy palate. Shimmering with taut, balanced acidity, fine tannins give focus to the long finish. Rich and ethereal, this is one to cellar. Bernhard Huber, Malterdingen Bienenberg, Baden, 2021, Score: 93 Seamless integration of vibrant red fruits and crisp acidity. Elegant with a touch of velvet to the mouthfeel despite fine youthful tannins. Exceptional drinking in 4-5 years. One of Germany's best. Franz Keller, Achkarren Schlossberg, Baden, 2021, Score: 93 This wine has all the elements of a fine, age-worthy Pinot Noir: an elegant, bright, silky, and restrained palate. Attractive sour cherry and plums on the long, layered finish. Will be a stunner. Bernhard Huber, Köndringen Alte Burg, Baden, 2021, Score: 93 On the nose, violets, damp earth, red forest fruits, and spice introduce the rich, robust palate. Carries textural depth and breadth seldom found in its peers. Silky tannins, and balanced acidity complete the package. Franz Keller, Oberbergen Bassgeige Steinriese, Baden, 2021, Score: 93 Born of a star vineyard site of volcanic rock, this is Franz Keller's top Pinot Noir. Though a lighter, leaner vintage, the wine still delivers on complexity and detail with fine-grained tannins. Offers a whiff of smoke and flintiness with blue and red fruits on the nose and palate. Light and airy in the mouth with a soft swaddle of oak, the finish is protracted and faceted from energetic acidity. Rudolf Fürst, Bürgstadt Hundsrück, Franken, 2021, Score: 92 From poor, rocky soil springs forth this miracle of Pinot Noir with its enchanting aromas of sour cherry and rose petals. The restrained Burgundian palate offers youthful red fruits, a touch of spice, and a wet earth note that will develop into a seductive beauty in a few years time. Staatlicher Hofkeller Würzburg, Großheubach Bischofsberg, Franken, 2021, Score: 92 Notes of crushed red raspberry, early spring strawberries, and red currants on the nose and palate. A touch of spice lends intrigue to the focused, chewy finish. Bernhard Huber, Bombach Sommerhalde, Baden, 2021, Score: 92 Crushed violet pastilles and ripe cherry aromas and flavors. Deft use of oak supports rather than overwhelms the fruit. In the throes of youth, tannins are still a bit grippy but will resolve into a seamless wine with time. Bernhard Huber, Hecklingen Schlossberg, Baden, 2021, Score: 92 Concentrated ripe red fruits on the nose and palate, with a racy acidity lending delineation and deliciousness to the extended finish. One to age in the cellar for at least ten years. Franz Keller, Oberrotweil Kirchberg, Baden, 2021, Score: 92 A wine of great finesse from a south-west site in Kirchberg, the nose offers inviting aromas of sour cherries, raspberries, and fresh roses. A hint of chocolate-dipped orange peel pops up on the palate, accentuated by brisk acidity and framed in fine-grained tannins. Oak is present but judicious. Has a long cellar life ahead. Rudolf Fürst, Bürgstadt Centgrafenberg, Franken, 2021, Score: 91 A touch cooler than Fürst's Schlossberg Spätburgunder, the vibrant nose offers delicate red fruits and an iron-like minerality. Elegant on the palate, complexity derives from its nuance rather than power. Balanced acidity, silky tannins and a long, lovely finish land this wine in the top bracket of Germany's best Pinot Noirs. Georg Müller Stiftung, Hattenheim Hassel, Rheingau, 2020, Score: 91 Shows wonderful concentration that's missing from many peers. Ripe red cherries and macerated strawberries are framed in a touch of wood and baking spice with bright acidity. A pleasure to taste, will evolve beautifully in a few years. Künstler, Hochheim Reichestal, Rheingau, 2019, Score: 91 Burgundian-style Pinot with a hint of smoke and minerality, ample ripe fruits from raspberry, cherry, to black plum, all framed in French oak and clove spice. Young, chewy tannins buffered by a firm backbone of acidity deliver a long, focused finish. There is plenty of substance for aging in the cellar. Steintal, Klingenberg Schlossberg, Franken, 2021, Score: 91 Lithe and supple with layers of fresh berry fruits atop gentle, youthful tannins. Energetic acidity sharpens the tapered finish. Does the wine live up to its notoriously high price, often tagged at 80 Euros? Those who can afford to do so should cellar this. Battenfeld-Spanier, Hohen-Sülzen Kirchenstück, Rheinhessen, 2021, Score: 91 The nose offers lovely fragrant aromas of violets, rose petals, and red cherries. Distinct in its class for its purity and transparency on the palate, this wine has a whiff of earth and minerality. Faceted, nuanced details make this a pleasure to taste and watch over time. Deutzerhof, Heimersheim Landskrone, Ahr, 2021, Score: 91 Fragrant, light and juicy, with crunchy red fruits. Though an odd comparison—Germany to California—it nevertheless evokes the early days of coastal California styles before concentrated jammy expressions, and climate change, took hold. Not overachieving, just cool-climate pretty for pretty's sake. Franz Keller, Jechtingen Enselberg, Baden, 2021, Score: 91 From a west-facing volcanic site, offers sour cherry, a whiff of licorice, and a mineral earthiness on the nose, with ripe tannins and crunchy red and black fruits on the palate. Good structure balanced by bright acidity, too young and closed to show its full scope at a preview tasting, but well-made and worth holding for several years. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn .

Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Topline The Supreme Court paused a lower court decision Thursday that limited the Biden Administration from pushing social media firms to remove what it considers to be misinformation about matters like Covid-19 and the 2020 presidential election. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito issued the administrative stay Thursday. (Photo by Chip ... [+] Somodevilla/Getty Images) Getty Images Key Facts Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito issued an administrative stay freezing a Louisiana district court’s ruling until September 22 and giving the high court more time to consider the Biden Administration’s request to block the decision. Last week, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals said the White House, FBI, Centers for Disease Control and Surgeon General cannot \"coerce or significantly encourage social-media companies to remove, delete, suppress, or reduce … posted social-media content containing protected free speech,” in a ruling that partially upheld the Louisiana court’s decision. The Biden Administration called for the Supreme Court to issue a stay so it could prepare to appeal the ruling, which materialized in response to a lawsuit from the GOP attorneys general of Louisiana and Missouri accusing government officials of coercing social media into moderating or removing content protected under the First Amendment. What To Watch For The Justice Department said it would appeal the order by October 13, according to Reuters . Alito’s order also said the plaintiffs should respond on or before September 20. Key Background A Louisiana judge found in July that government officials specifically coerced Meta, Facebook, YouTube and X, formerly known as Twitter, into squashing Covid-19 and election fraud posts that were legally protected under the First Amendment. The ruling was partially upheld by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last week, but its scope was narrowed to exclude government agencies like the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who called for the Supreme Court to block the Louisiana injunction, criticized it as “vastly overbroad” and said the court imposed limits on the FBI’s ability to address national security threats and the CDC’s ability to “relay public health information at platforms’ request,” according to NBC .

Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Wheels Up is again turning to Delta Air Lines for C-suite leadership. After appointing the Atlanta-based airline’s CFO Dan Janki as Chairman last month, the New York-based private jet flight provider is tapping Delta Board Member George Mattson as CEO. He replaces Interim CEO Todd Smith, who returns to his CFO role. Smith moved to the corner office after Founder, Chairman, and CEO Kenny Dichter stepped aside in May amid mounting losses. Mattson is a member of Delta’s Board of Directors since 2012. His experience includes a decade at Goldman Sachs & Co. During his tenure he was partner and co-head of Goldman’s Global Industrials Group in Investment Banking focused on airlines and transportation. He has been Chairman of Tropic Ocean Airways, a large operator of seaplanes, since 2014. Wheels Up incoming CEO George Mattson (left) and Interim CEO Todd Smith, who will continue is his ... [+] CFO role. Mattson, who is a member of the Delta Air Lines board joins Delta CFO Dan Janki, who was appointed Chairman of the private jet flight provider last month. Wheels Up This morning’s news comes as Wheels Up is working to finalize a $500 million investment led by Delta. According to a press release, the agreement was “a non-binding agreement which is expected to include funds contributed by Delta, CK Opportunities Fund I, LP, which is co-managed by affiliates of Certares Management LLC and Knighthead Capital Management LLC, and certain other lenders. The transaction is subject to completing definitive documentation, as well as customary closing conditions and other approvals.” The deal would give Delta and financial partners a 95% stake in the 2013 startup, which has struggled to merge a half-dozen acquisitions and failure to hit profit targets since its July 2021 IPO despite exceeding sales goals.

The changes made during his tenure are expected to stabilize the business and will help drive future profitability and an elevated experience for our members. Todd will continue his work as Wheels Up CFO.\" “In 10 years, Wheels Up has grown from a startup into a global leader in private aviation, with a strong consumer brand and loyal member community,” Mattson said. “I look forward to leading the Wheels Up team, with the operational, commercial, strategic and financial support of Delta and our other new investors. Delivering best-in-class operating performance and exceptional customer experiences, consistently and profitably, will attract more members to our community as we begin the next chapter of the Wheels Up story.” During an interview yesterday, Mattson indicated that Wheels Up would push to the back burner its ambitious plans to create an Airbnb, Expedia-like digital marketplace for private jet charter flights. Instead, it will focus on improving operations, reliability and becoming profitable. “Broader initiatives, the marketplace, we’re going to continue to look at and evaluate and save for another day. Our near-term focus is important areas that underpin our ability to execute in our operation and for our customers. I really want to kind of narrow the focus initially to make sure we nail that before you take on broader and more ambitious goals,” said Mattson. He continued, “You could argue that (Wheels Up was) victims of their own success and outran their ability to manage it sufficiently, which is obviously, absolutely critical in any business, but especially critical in the airline business. We’re going to build off of that success from the past, take everything we can from it, and take it forward into a new chapter, which is really going to be underpinned by sustainability of performance, sustainability financially, and operational excellence, which has to underpin any consistently excellent customer experience. And those two things are inextricably linked, and we are never going to be losing sight of that. That’s going to earn us the right to grow again and to be even more successful in the future.” Mattson said Wheels Up will be tapping the Delta playbook. “Delta wasn’t always viewed as the most reliable airline. It was a journey that started after the Delta-Northwest merger and has taken a decade. But if you go back 15 years, the idea of a zero-cancellation day at a mainline airline was unheard of. Never happened. And now (Delta has) 250 of them a year or so. Things that haven’t been done or weren’t thought possible, you know, can happen. And that’s the kind of mindset and attitude we want to take to deliver a new reality for operational excellence and performance at Wheels Up,” Mattson added. Earlier this year, Wheels Up opened a new centralized operations center in Atlanta. Covering a variety of subjects, he said that the previously announced agreement to sell the Wheels Up aircraft management business to Airshare is on track to close by the end of this quarter or the beginning of Q4. The incoming CEO dismissed concerns that the pending investment won’t be enough. “The $500 million is sufficient to execute the plan. There are lots of opportunities to drive efficiencies, cost synergies, and revenue that are part of the future that weren’t part of the past until we were able to align with Delta and our other partners through this transaction much more closely,” he said. Through the first half of 2023, Wheels Up ranked as the fourth-largest North American private jet operator based on charter and fractional flight hours. It has over 11,000 members. During Q2 revenue decreased 21% to $335 million year-over-year from $425 million. Net loss increased $68 million year-over-year to $161 million, including a $70 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge. Adjusted EBITDA dropped 14% year-over-year from $47 million to $40 million. Cash and Cash Equivalents fell from $363 million to $151 million. In recent weeks Delta has provided Wheels Up with $60 million of interim financial support. Twice earlier this year it has had to rebut reports of a bankruptcy filing that would have jeopardized monies members pay in advance for future flights. Blocks of flight time typically range from $100,000 to $400,000. Wheels Up is hoping to generate incremental revenue from business flyers by selling flights to Delta’s corporate accounts via the airline’s sales team. Its current mix is heavily leisure focused, with high fleet utilization on Fridays and Sundays, but extra capacity during the week. It has moved to cut loss by focusing the areas it offers guaranteed flights at capped hourly rates to regions with higher customer and route density. The strategy is expected to cut the cost of repositioning flights and speed up recovery flights when there are mechanical delays. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn .

      "description": "The post Private water well screenings set for the Rolling Plains Sept. 25-28 appeared first on AgriLife Today.",
      "content": "The Texas Well Owner Network , TWON, is hosting six upcoming events in the Rolling Plains on Sept. 25-28 to allow residents to have their well water screened. Two “Well Educated” water well screenings will be in Benjamin and Springtown and four “Well Informed” water well screenings will be in Granbury, Henrietta, Montague and Vernon. Joel Pigg, Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service program specialist and TWON coordinator, Bryan-College Station, said the program is for Texas residents who depend on household wells for their water needs. “The TWON program was established to help well owners become familiar with Texas groundwater resources, septic system maintenance, well maintenance and construction, and water quality and treatment,” he said. “It allows them to learn more about how to improve and protect their community water resources.” Water samples will be screened for contaminants, including total coliform bacteria, E. coli, arsenic, nitrate-nitrogen and salinity. There will be a $15 per sample cost for the water well screening, unless otherwise noted. — Granbury area: Sept. 25, water samples can be dropped off from 8:30-10 a.m. at the AgriLife Extension office for Hood County, Hood County Annex 1, Room 22, 1410 W. Pearl St. in Granbury or the Upper Trinity Groundwater Conservation District, GCD, office, 1859 W. Highway 199 in Springtown. The follow-up meeting to explain the results of the screenings will be on Sept. 26 at 6 p.m. at the Texas A&M Forest Service-Granbury, 450 Howard Clemmons Drive. — Vernon area: Sept. 25, water samples can be dropped off from 8:30-10 a.m. at the AgriLife Extension offices in Wilbarger County, 1700 Wilbarger St., Room 29 in Vernon, or Wichita County, 600 Scott St., Suite 200 in Wichita Falls. The follow-up meeting to explain the results of the screenings will be Sept. 26 from 8:30 a.m.-12:30 p.m. at the Wilbarger County Exhibit Building, 2215 Harold St. in Vernon. — Clay County and Archer County areas: Sept. 26, water samples can be dropped off from 8:30-10 a.m. at the AgriLife Extension offices for Clay County, 210 W. Ikard St., Suite B in Henrietta, or Archer County, 512 W. Cottonwood St. in Archer City. The follow-up meeting to explain the results of the screenings will be at 6 p.m. Sept. 28 at Clay County Community Center, 216 N. Hancock St. in Henrietta. — Rolling Plains area: Sept. 25, water samples can be dropped off from 8:30-10 a.m. at the AgriLife Extension offices for Knox County, 109 E. Hayes St., Benjamin, or Baylor County, 500 N. Main St., Seymour; or the Rolling Plains Groundwater Conservation District office, 135 N. Munday Ave., Munday. There will be no cost for the water well screening. The follow-up meeting to explain the results of the screenings will be from 8:30 a.m. till 12:30 p.m. Sept. 27 at the AgriLife Extension office in Benjamin. — Montague area: Water samples can be dropped off on Sept. 26 from 8:30-10 a.m. at the Montague County Annex Community Room, 11339 Texas Highway 59, Montague. The follow-up meeting to explain the results of the screenings will be at 6 p.m. Sept. 27 at the Montague County Annex. — Parker County and Wise County areas: Sept. 27, water samples can be dropped off from 8:30-10 a.m. at the AgriLife Extension offices for Parker County, 604 N. Main St., Suite 200 in Weatherford, or for Wise County, 206 S. State St., Suite A in Decatur; or the Upper Trinity Groundwater Conservation District office, 1859 W. Highway 199, Springtown. The follow-up meeting to explain the results of the screenings will be Sept. 26 from 3-7 p.m. at the Springtown Senior Center, 1070 N. Main St., Springtown. Pigg said area residents wanting to have their well water screened should pick up a sample bag, bottle and instructions from their local AgriLife Extension office. “It is very important that only sampling bags and bottles from the AgriLife Extension offices be used, and all instructions for proper sampling are followed to ensure accurate results,” he said. Private water wells should be tested annually, he said. The samples will be screened for contaminants, including total coliform bacteria, E. coli, nitrate-nitrogen and salinity. Pigg said it is essential for those submitting samples to be at the appropriate follow-up meeting to receive results, learn corrective measures for identified problems and improve their understanding of private well management. John Smith, AgriLife Extension program specialist, Bryan-College Station, said research shows the presence of E. coli bacteria in water indicates that waste from humans or warm-blooded animals may have contaminated the water. Water contaminated with E. coli is more likely to also have pathogens that can cause diarrhea, cramps, nausea or other symptoms. The presence of nitrate-nitrogen in well water is also a concern, and water with nitrate-nitrogen at levels of 10 parts per million is considered unsafe for human consumption, he said. “These nitrate levels above 10 parts per million can disrupt the ability of blood to carry oxygen throughout the body, resulting in a condition called methemoglobinemia,” Pigg said. “Infants less than 6 months of age and young livestock are most susceptible to this.” Salinity, as measured by total dissolved solids, will also be determined for each sample, he said. Water with high levels may leave deposits and have a salty taste. Using water with high levels for irrigation may damage soil or plants.

For more information on the water screening, contact Pigg at 979-845-1461 or j-pigg@tamu.edu , or Smith at 979-204-0573 or john.smith@ag.tamu.edu . The screenings are presented by AgriLife Extension and the Texas Water Resources Institute , TWRI, in partnership with the AgriLife Extension offices in Knox, Baylor, Wilbarger, Wichita, Archer, Clay, Montague, Wise, Parker and Hood counties. Additional support is provided by Rolling Plains GCD and the Upper Trinity GCD. Funding for TWON is through a Clean Water Act nonpoint source grant provided by the Texas State Soil and Water Conservation Board and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency . The project is managed by TWRI, part of Texas A&M AgriLife Research , AgriLife Extension and the Texas A&M College of Agriculture and Life Sciences . -30-",

Sharing inspiring and practical stories from around the world. Following Sep 14, 2023, 04:39pm EDT | Press play to listen to this article! Got it! Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Kids and adults should get zen on vacation Four Seasons Punta Mita In today's hospitality industry, only some resorts truly grasp the art of holistically catering to adults and children. Four Seasons Resort Punta Mita , especially post-pandemic, has discerned the growing need for parents and children to emphasize mental and physical wellness. What makes Punta Mita uniquely captivating is its commitment to striking a balance, ensuring both age groups are indulged in equal measure. Upon entering the resort, guests will immediately notice the delineation of spaces curated for adults and children. While young guests can splash around and have fun in the resort's playful lazy river, adults in search of tranquility can gravitate towards the serene ambiance of the adults-only pool. This thoughtful separation ensures that all guests have an environment tailored to their relaxation and enjoyment. Recreational activities, too, echo this harmonious balance. Surfing, an emblematic sport of the region, is not restricted to the seasoned. Both adults and children can take lessons, allowing families to bond over the shared exhilaration of riding the waves. For the little ones, a private piñata-making class offers an immersive dip into the local culture, complete with learning the traditional piñata song. Simultaneously, adults can indulge in a sophisticated custom tequila blending experience, diving deep into the rich heritage of this iconic Mexican spirit. KidsWell isn't just another children's program – it's a comprehensive initiative focusing on young guests' mental and physical well-being. Under the expert guidance of Erika Ibarra Zepeda, who boasts a rich background in psychology and children's studies, the program offers a blend of activities aimed at holistic development. Kids can engage in bubble-blowing breathwork, guided meditation, and even rainbow relaxation watercolor classes. These activities aren't just for fun; they're designed to equip kids with relaxation techniques and emotional tools they can use daily. As John O'Sullivan, Regional Vice President and General Manager of the resort, mentioned, \"KidsWell is about imparting positive mindsets. It's a platform where kids learn practices that stay with them long after their vacation ends.\" MORE FOR YOU New Pixel 8 Pro Leaks Reveal Google’s Smart Decision Critical New 1Password Signal Chrome Edge Firefox Emergency Security Updates 2023 Layoff Tracker Airtable Cuts Over 25 Of Its Staff As Google Lays Off Recruiters For adults, wellness at the resort goes beyond just fun activities. The Punta Mita Tequila Stone treatment stands out among the available therapeutic services. This therapy, rooted in a traditional blend of tequila and sage oil, aims to alleviate muscle tightness, boost circulation, and improve joint flexibility. Therapists skillfully use their hands, forearms, and heated stones during the treatment to apply varying pressure levels. Another notable service harnesses the antioxidant-rich Hakali cactus. In this massage, the emphasis is on the lymphatic system. Therapists utilize gentle stretches and apply light pressure, enhanced by the soothing combination of warm cactus gel and sage cream. This aids in toxin removal, decreasing swelling, relaxing muscles, and refreshing skin. In a post-pandemic, digitally saturated world, the quest for wellness has transcended from a luxury to a necessity. For the hospitality industry, the golden ticket lies in tapping into this unquenchable thirst for holistic well-being— but for all age groups, not just adults. The resorts leading the pack offer carefully curated experiences aimed at relaxation and deep, meaningful engagement and wellness for both parents and children. Programs that focus on young guests' emotional and mental well-being are becoming more than just a value-added service; they're a vital component of a memorable stay. For adults, wellness has evolved beyond mere spa treatments to immersive experiences rooted in local traditions, making relaxation an educational journey. It's about balancing— creating separate but equally enriching environments where adults and children can explore, learn, and relax. It's not just about filling rooms; it's about enriching lives, one holistic experience at a time. And in an era where meaningful travel is increasingly sought after, catering to the well-being of all family members isn't just good ethics; it's good business. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn .

      "content": "Forbes Lifestyle Cars & Bikes Car Insurance Rates Are Skyrocketing. Here’s Which Models Will Cost The Least To Cover Jim Gorzelany Senior Contributor Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. I write about how to maximize your automotive investment and more. Following Sep 14, 2023, 04:27pm EDT | Press play to listen to this article! Got it! Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin The average yearly premium for a full coverage policy jumped by 14% over the past year. getty With the pandemic firmly in the nation’s rearview mirror, U.S. drivers are again racking up the miles on the nation’s highways, and are also being subjected to higher car insurance premiums. According to the analytics company Quadrant Information Services, the average yearly premium for a full coverage policy jumped from $1,771 last year to $2,014 in 2023, which represents a budget-busting 14% increase. We can largely blame inflation and the auto industry’s recent supply and demand problems for higher auto insurance costs. New vehicles have become more expensive both to purchase and repair, with costlier parts costs and labor rates in particular hiking claims. Higher health-care costs associated with injuries caused by accidents is also at issue here. Analysts see little in the way of relief down the road, so astute consumers would be advised to tighten their purse strings and become proactive in seeking more-affordable auto coverage. Auto insurance rates are largely based on a policyholder’s personal information. Younger, single, male drivers living in crowded urban areas with poor credit ratings and pockmarked driving records will generally pay the most for coverage. Rates will also differ—sometimes dramatically—from one state to another depending on a variety of factors. While factors like demographics and past accidents and traffic citations are for the most part intractable, those looking for a new vehicle can salve their premiums a bit by choosing a make and model that’s inherently cheaper to cover than others. Generally speaking, the most-affordable models to insure are those that tend to be driven gently, get top safety ratings and are cheaper to repair should they get into a wreck. That tends to favor safe and sound mainstream SUVs and minivans. The personal finance website Bankrate.com ranks the Subaru Outback crossover SUV as the price leader for 2023 at an average $1,603 for full coverage which will, of course, vary according to a policyholder’s aforementioned personal factors. MORE FOR YOU New Pixel 8 Pro Leaks Reveal Google’s Smart Decision Critical New 1Password Signal Chrome Edge Firefox Emergency Security Updates 2023 Layoff Tracker Airtable Cuts Over 25 Of Its Staff As Google Lays Off Recruiters The models suffering the highest premiums tend to be luxury models that cost the most to fix and have a steeper cost threshold before being scrapped. Likewise with high-performance cars that practically beg to be driven fast and furiously. For example, those who own a red-hot Dodge Charger sports coupe will face an average $2,824 for yearly coverage, and lots more for those having moving violations and/or at-fault claims on their records. Electric cars, which carry higher-than-average sticker prices and are based around expensive battery packs that can total some models if they’re damaged in a wreck, also cost more than average to insure. According to Bankrate.com, the compact Tesla Model Y SUV leads the pack for 2023 in this regard, and will set the average owner back $2,804 in yearly premiums. We’re listing the models having the least- and most-expensive annual auto insurance premiums among the 27 vehicles the website considered below. Other than shopping for a new ride, those looking to keep their car insurance premiums affordable should check prices among multiple carriers every year or so to see if a better deal is available, given one’s personal information. This is especially important among those who’ve recently taken life-changing turns like moving to a new city, getting married or divorced or racking up traffic tickets and/or crashes. Some carriers are more willing to accept what it perceives as certain levels of risk on a more-or-less costly basis than others. Cash-sensitive owners can also lower a policy’s liability coverage to state minimums, raise deductibles for comprehensive and collision-damage and drop add-ons like towing and rental car provisions. Finally, make sure to obtain every discount a given carrier is offering. These include rate reductions for teens and seniors who’ve taken approved safe-driving courses, those who bundle coverage for multiple vehicles and/or homeowner’s insurance with the same company, pay a year’s premiums annually and so on. Though it may seem intrusive, many companies now offer lower rates depending upon a motorist’s driving habits, based on data collected from a vehicle’s onboard diagnostics port.

      "description": "Today we look at Ted Cruz's and Elizabeth Warren’s lucrative side hustles.",
      "content": "Today we look at Ted Cruz’s and Elizabeth Warren’s lucrative side hustles. Sen. Ted Cruz did not violate the law prohibiting the use of campaign funds for personal gain when his campaign bought Facebook ads in 2020 to tout his book, the bipartisan Federal Election Commission ruled unanimously in a decision made public on Wednesday. The Texas Republican provided an affidavit showing he had donated his royalties to a charity, convincing commissioners to reverse their earlier, preliminary decision that there was “reason to believe” he had violated the Federal Election Campaign Act. Cruz’s second book, “One Vote Away: How A Single Supreme Court Seat Can Change History” hit book stores in September 2020. The following week, his campaign’s Facebook page began running ads directing fans to retailers to purchase it. Cruz’s campaign paid Facebook about $14,000 to run the spots, according to an analysis of Facebook’s political ad archive by the Campaign Legal Center, a government watchdog. Elizabeth Warren has earned $4.6 million from book advances and royalties during her tenure in the Senate, according to 10 years of financial disclosures . The haul is more than double what the Massachusetts Democrat has made over that period from her $174,000-a-year day job. Before her election to the Senate in 2012, Warren, then a professor at Harvard Law School, authored books on academic topics like secured credit and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, as well as less niche subjects like the financial struggles of the middle class. A year into her Senate tenure, she inked a deal to write her memoir, “A Fighting Chance,” which came out the following spring. She has gone on to publish three more works while in office, most recently the children’s picture book “Pinkie Promises,” which reached booksellers in 2021. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy cited a string of allegations against President Joe Biden related to his son’s foreign business dealings in opening a formal impeachment inquiry into the president Tuesday—though none of the claims have produced solid evidence of illegality on Biden’s part, and McCarthy was careful to frame some of them as accusations, reports Sara Dorn. In response, the White House sharply criticized McCarthy (R-Calif.) for launching an impeachment probe without seeking approval from the majority of the chamber, accusing the speaker of reversing course on his plans for a formal House vote and acting on “no evidence of wrongdoing.” The amount of campaign funds House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) donated to the Bakersfield College Foundation before his alma mater inducted him into its hall of fame in 2022. The amount of requests for additional information the Federal Election Commission sent the campaign of former Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) in August. The amount the International Longshoremen’s Association Committee on Political Education donated to the legal defense fund of Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) in August. Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. joins “Forbes Newsroom” to discuss the Democratic National Committee, the 2024 Democratic primary process, President Biden and more. The Trump Organization announced Tuesday it is selling its public golf course in New York City, Trump Golf Links at Ferry Point, to Bally’s Corporation, with the transfer operations and management effective immediately, reports Molly Bohannon. A group in Minnesota filed a lawsuit on Tuesday challenging whether former President Donald Trump can be on the 2024 ballot under the 14th Amendment, which states anyone who took an oath to support the Constitution and then “engaged in insurrection or rebellion against” it is disqualified. This marks the second recent lawsuit claiming Trump is ineligible to be on the ballot, reports Molly Bohannon. What is the title of the children’s book Elizabeth Warren published in 2021? a. “Cross My Heart And Hope To Die” b. “Spit Handshakes” c. “An Indigenous Peoples’ History of the United States for Young People” d. “Pinkie Promises” Check if you got it right here .",
